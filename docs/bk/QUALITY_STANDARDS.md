## Code Quality

### TypeScript Standards

- [ ] Use strict TypeScript mode
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] Proper null/undefined handling
- [ ] Consistent type imports/exports
- [ ] Proper use of interfaces vs types

### Code Style

- [ ] Follow Angular Style Guide
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- [ ] Maximum file length: 400 lines
- [ ] Maximum function length: 50 lines
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No `console.log` in production code

## Component Architecture

### Component Structure

- [ ] Follows single responsibility principle
- [ ] Proper component composition
- [ ] Smart vs Presentational component separation
- [ ] Proper use of lifecycle hooks
- [ ] Clean template syntax

### Services

- [ ] Single responsibility
- [ ] Proper dependency injection
- [ ] Stateless when possible
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] API calls abstracted in services

## State Management

### Component State

- [ ] Minimal local state
- [ ] Proper use of `@Input()` and `@Output()`
- [ ] Immutable state updates
- [ ] No direct state mutation

### Global State (if using NgRx/Akita/Ngxs)

- [ ] Actions follow naming convention
- [ ] Selectors for derived state
- [ ] Effects for side effects
- [ ] Proper state normalization

## Performance

### Bundle Size

- [ ] Lazy loaded feature modules
- [ ] Code splitting
- [ ] Tree-shaking compatible imports
- [ ] Bundle size monitoring

### Runtime Performance

- [ ] OnPush change detection
- [ ] `trackBy` in `*ngFor`
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Memoization for expensive computations

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- [ ] 80%+ code coverage
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] No test skipping without reason
- [ ] Meaningful test descriptions
- [ ] No test interdependencies

### E2E Tests

- [ ] Critical user journeys covered
- [ ] Test data cleanup
- [ ] Flake-free tests
- [ ] Visual regression testing

## Accessibility

### ARIA

- [ ] Proper ARIA attributes
- [ ] Screen reader support
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus management

### Color Contrast

- [ ] WCAG AA compliance
- [ ] Color-blind friendly palettes
- [ ] High contrast mode support

## Security

### Input Validation

- [ ] Client-side validation
- [ ] Server-side validation
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection

### Dependencies

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Audit npm packages

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Version Control

### Commit Messages

- [ ] Conventional commits
- [ ] Meaningful commit messages
- [ ] Atomic commits
- [ ] No large binary files

### Branching Strategy

- [ ] Feature branches
- [ ] Pull request templates
- [ ] Code review requirements
- [ ] Protected main branch

## CI/CD

### Build Process

- [ ] Automated builds
- [ ] Build caching
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Build time monitoring

### Deployment

- [ ] Automated deployments
