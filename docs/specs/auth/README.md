# Beautyâ€‘SaaS Authentication Specs (Consolidated)
**Version:** 2025-09-01  
**Status:** Draft (aligned to User Stories v2)  
**Scope:** Single NestJS backend + 3 Angular frontends (Admin/Partner/Customer).

Key decisions:
- **Cookie-based auth** (AT short-lived, RT rotating in HttpOnly cookies).
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn)** + **TOTP** for strong auth; **Email OTP** only as fallback. **No SMS OTP**.
- **Flexible password reset** with recovery codes.
- **Access log vs Application log** separated. Audit events structured.
- **SSO across subdomains** (e.g., `admin.cthub.in`, `partner.cthub.in`, `app.cthub.in`) via cookie domain `.cthub.in`.
