# Hero Section

## Overview
The hero section is the main visual component of the home page, designed to capture user attention and guide them to key actions.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Content
- Dynamic welcome message based on time of day and user authentication status
- Primary call-to-action button (e.g., "Book Now", "Find a Salon")
- Secondary call-to-action link
- Background image or video
- Search bar for salons/services

### 2. User Interaction
- Search functionality with auto-suggest
- Mobile-responsive design
- Smooth animations on scroll
- Performance optimized for fast loading

### 3. Personalization
- Show personalized greeting for authenticated users
- Display location-based content when available
- Remember user preferences (e.g., dark/light mode)

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface HeroSectionProps {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: User | null;
  onSearch: (query: string) => void;
  onPrimaryAction: () => void;
  onSecondaryAction: () => void;
}
```

### Data Model
```typescript
interface HeroContent {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  primaryAction: {
    text: string;
    route: string;
  };
  secondaryAction: {
    text: string;
    route: string;
  };
  background: {
    type: 'image' | 'video';
    src: string;
    alt: string;
  };
  searchPlaceholder: string;
}
```

### API Integration
- Fetches dynamic content from `/api/content/hero`
- Supports A/B testing for different variants
- Caches content for performance

## Styling
- Full viewport height on desktop
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Theming support

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load background media
- Optimize images (WebP format with fallbacks)
- Implement intersection observer for animations
- Critical CSS inlined

## Testing
- Unit tests for component logic
- Visual regression tests
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing

## Analytics
- Track user interactions
- Measure conversion rates
- Monitor load performance
- A/B test different variants
