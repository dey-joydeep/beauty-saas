# Review & Rating API Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Users can add reviews for salons only if they have a completed appointment for that salon.
- Reviews must include:
  - salon_id
  - user_id
  - rating (integer, 1-5)
  - review text (non-empty string)
- The system must validate:
  - User is eligible (has completed appointment)
  - Rating is between 1 and 5
  - Review text is not empty
- Anyone can view reviews for a salon, sorted by newest first.
- The system must provide endpoints to:
  - Add a review
  - Get all reviews for a salon
  - Get average rating and review count for a salon
- Average rating and review count must be aggregated from the database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), not from demo/in-memory data.
- All error conditions (invalid input, ineligible user, etc.) must return appropriate error messages and codes.
