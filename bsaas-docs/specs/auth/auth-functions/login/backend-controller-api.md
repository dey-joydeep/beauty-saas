# Authentication - Backend API Implementation

## Overview

This document provides implementation details for the authentication backend API. For the complete API reference, including all endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes, please see the main [API Documentation](../API.md).

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits login credentials
2. Server validates credentials against the database
3. If 2FA is enabled, an OTP is generated and sent
4. On successful authentication, JWT tokens are issued
5. Tokens are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies

### Security Implementation

- Password hashing using Argon2id
- JWT tokens signed with ES256
- CSRF protection via same-site cookies
- Rate limiting for all authentication endpoints

### Error Handling

All error responses follow the standard format defined in the main API documentation. Common error cases include:

- Invalid credentials
- Account locked due to too many attempts
- Expired or invalid tokens
- Validation errors for input fields

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented as specified in the main API documentation. The following limits apply to login-related endpoints:

- Login attempts: 10 per 5 minutes per IP
- Failed attempts before lockout: 5
- Lockout duration: 15 minutes

## Session Management

Sessions are managed using JWT tokens with the following characteristics:

- Access token: 15-minute expiration
- Refresh token: 7-day expiration with rotation
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Server-side session invalidation on logout

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request

```json
{
  "error": "validation_error",
  "message": "Invalid input data",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "Must be a valid email address"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_credentials",
  "message": "Invalid email or password"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "account_locked",
  "message": "Account locked due to too many failed attempts",
  "retryAfter": 900
}
```

### 429 Too Many Requests

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many login attempts. Please try again later.",
  "retryAfter": 60
}
```

## Security Headers

- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

## Audit Logging

All authentication events are logged with:

- Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- IP address
- User agent
- Event type (login, logout, failed_attempt)
- Success/failure status
- Reason for failure (if applicable)
- Device fingerprint
- Location data (if available)

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Input validation
- Token generation and verification
- Password hashing and verification
- Session management

### Integration Tests

- Full login flow
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting
- Session persistence

## Dependencies

- JWT for token generation/validation
- BCrypt for password hashing
- Redis for token blacklisting
- Database for user storage
- Email service for account verification
- Logging service for audit logs
